Lagrange Interpolation & Application in recursive problems(DP).

Q. What is Lagrange Interpolation ? 
A. https://brilliant.org/wiki/lagrange-interpolation/
tl;dr : Lagrange interpolaton is a method of constructing a polynomial function(hence estimating new data points) given a set of discrete data points.

Simple Mathematical analogy.

Given:
f(x) is a unique (n - 1) degree polynomial.

f(x) = a + a1x + a2x^2 + .....anx^n

f(x1) = y1, fx(x2) = y2, f(x3) = y3 ...... f(xn-1) = yn-1.

Find:
f(xn)

Time complexity: 
O(n^2), if x1, x2, are discrete points.
O(n), O(nlogn) if x1, x2 , x3 are continuous points. 
Think precomputaion, convoluting around a point + binary exponenetaion to reduce the complexity for the inner computations o O(n).

Application in dynamic Programmng and solving recursive problems:

Given : 
f(x) = i + i^2 + i^3 +..... i^k, k <= 1e6, 

Find: 
f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) + ......f(n), n <= 1e12.

Solution:
1. Interpolate the function f(x), since it is (k + 1)th degree polynomial, find(k + 2) data points
leveraging this relation f(x) = f(x - 1) + x^k.
